# Helsinki Events App

We are creating an app that lets you see and browse events in Helsinki.

## Our aim is that our app will:

- Show local events in Helsinki.
- Let you filter events by for example: language, location, date etc.
- Function smoothly, with a sleek and innovative yet simple design.
- Be mobile friendly(?)
- Integrate an API so that the events actually exists.

Our team and roles are:

- Pinja: Backend/frontend developer.
- Alona: Frontend developer.
- Iman: Scrum master/filler.
- Ben: Technical lead/filler.
